## Example 
- Airport Assistant:
  - It can access data such as airports, flights, and local amenities via AlloyDB. Pretend you're a passenger at San Francisco International Airport (SFO); Airport Assistant can help answer questions such as:
    - Where can I get coffee near gate A6?
    - Where can I find a gift for my friend?
    - What flights are headed to New York City tomorrow?
