# Android System Development On Cloud Code Labs
This curates guides, code labs &amp; resources to learn Android System
Development on the Cloud. So that, anyone can learn all aspects of A system
development by building an OS, an app framework & devices on a browser from
anywhere.

1. Why [AOSP](https://source.android.com/)?
  - Because the full stack of A system enables the permissionless innovation
   for anyone.
2. Why Android Virtual Device?
  - Because a high fidelity emulation tool removes HW barriers for rapid
   prototyping, fast iteration, easier automation & work from anywhere. A good
   way to leverage [the power of SoftWare-Defined](https://samlin001.medium.com/the-new-age-of-software-defined-2ae97c6d3281).
3. Why the Cloud?
  - Because it lowers the entry batter as only a browser needed to get started
   & easy to scale multiple development setups or a big development team quicker.
